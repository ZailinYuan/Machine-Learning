# SVM 
This classifier uses radial-basis kernel and regularization parameter to 'soft' margin.<br />
We trying to find best parameters for the classifier.

# Files:
* svm_changing_regularization_params.py  -->  change regularization parameters and find out how the testing error rate changes. <br />
* svm_changing_kernel_params.py  -->  change kernel parameters and find out how the testing error rate changes. <br /><br />
* svm_breast_cancer  -->  change both parameters to find the best combination of the two that generating the best accuracy.

# How to run it:
svm_changing_regularization_params.py  and   svm_changing_kernel_params.py: just run them. <br />
svm_breast_cancer: save this file in the same directory as wdbc_trn.csv, wdbc_val.csv and wdbc_tst.csv, which are the data files. Then run it.

# Results:
Pictures show up when running and accuracy on console when finished.
